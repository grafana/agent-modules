Module: structured-metadata
Description: This module is responsible for setting structured metadata from extracted fields and labels.
             High-cardinality labels that are not commonly queried can impact the way that queries perform,
             creating unnecessary streams.  This information may or may not be in a log line, but can be
             potentially useful.  Think of the label "pod", this is a very high cardinality label that is
             not commonly queried against but may be needed to filter against occassionally, this should
             be structured metadata.  It should be called near the end of the pipeline before keep labels is applied.
